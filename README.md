This Python code defines a GUI application for extracting data from PDFs using the tkinter library for the GUI, pdf2image to convert PDF pages into images, pytesseract for OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and pandas to export the extracted data to Excel.

Features of the application:
Open PDF: The user can select a PDF file using a file dialog. The PDF pages are converted into images using pdf2image.

Select regions on the PDF page: After opening the PDF, the user can select rectangular areas on the displayed page. The rectangles will be used to define areas from which text will be extracted.

Extract data from selected regions: The text in the selected regions is extracted using OCR with pytesseract and stored for later export.

Export extracted data to Excel: After extracting the text from the selected regions, the user can export this data to an Excel file using pandas.



Detailed Explanation of the Code:

PDFExtractorApp class: This class contains the main application logic.

Constructor (__init__): Sets up the basic UI elements (buttons for opening PDF, extracting data, and displaying images on a canvas).

open_pdf method: Opens a PDF file using a file dialog and loads its pages as images.

load_pdf method: Converts the PDF to images and displays the first page.

display_pdf_page method: Displays the current page of the PDF image on a canvas in the Tkinter window.

Region selection (on_button_press, on_mouse_drag, on_button_release): These methods handle the mouse events for selecting rectangular areas on the canvas.

extract_and_export method: This method processes the selected areas on each page, extracts text using OCR, and exports the results to an Excel file.

extract_text_from_image method: Uses Tesseract OCR to extract text from the given image.

export_to_excel method: Exports the extracted text data to an Excel file.



Dependencies:

1-tkinter: For the GUI.

2-PIL (Pillow): For image processing.

3-pandas: For working with data and exporting to Excel.

4-pdf2image: For converting PDF pages to images.

5-pytesseract: For OCR text extraction.



Example Usage:

Run the application: After launching the script, the Tkinter window will appear with buttons to open a PDF and extract data to Excel.
Open a PDF: Clicking "Open PDF" opens a file dialog to select a PDF. The first page of the PDF will be displayed on the canvas.
Select regions: Click and drag to select rectangular areas on the canvas where text will be extracted.
Extract and Export: Click "Extract to Excel" to process the selected regions and export the extracted data to an Excel file.



Additional Notes:

You will need to install the required libraries (pytesseract, pdf2image, Pillow, and pandas) if you havenâ€™t already. You can install them using pip:

pip install pytesseract pdf2image pillow pandas

You may also need to install Tesseract itself (the OCR engine).

It can be downloaded from here. Make sure the tesseract executable is in your system's PATH or specify the path in the script using pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd.

This script provides a solid foundation for building a PDF data extraction tool, especially if you're working with scanned PDFs where text needs to be extracted using OCR.
